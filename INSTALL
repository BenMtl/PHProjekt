1. Requirements

  * HTTP Server
  * MySql version 5.x
  * PHP 5.2.x with pdo_mysql drivers installed

  Note: Phprojekt 6 has been tested with:

    * Apache HTTP Server 2.2
    * PHP 5.2.6
    * MySQL Server 5.0

2. Installation

 1. Download the compressed package file and decompress it into an appropriate
    folder outside the ones accessed by your HTTP server.

     $ cd /var/www/
     $ tar xzvf phprojekt.tar.gz

    Use your favorite packaging tool on Windows under an appropriate path "C:\phprojekt\"

 2. Phprojekt separates both the document root from the rest application, so you want to point
    your server host to the 'htdocs' folder. In the example given, would
    be:

    UNIX        /var/www/htdocs/
    WINDOWS     C:\phprojekt\htdocs\

 3. Create a database on your MySQL server (e.g. phprojekt6). Make sure that the
    database user that you want to use has the rights to load files.
    An example:

      $ mysql -u root
      > CREATE DATABASE `phprojekt6`;
      > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `phprojekt6`.* TO phprojekt@localhost IDENTIFIED BY `phprojekt6`;
      > FLUSH ALL PRIVILEGES

 4. Database:

    UNIX        /var/www/docs/blank_database.sql
    WINDOWS     c:\phprojekt\docs\blank_database.sql

    and load it into the database. You might want to use MySQL Administration tools
    or PHPMyAdmin. You can also use the command line to do so:

      $ mysql -u phprojekt6 -p < /var/www/docs/blank_database.sql

3. Configuration

 1. Make a copy of configuration.ini-dist in the same folder, name it
    configuration.ini and set its parameters according to the explanations and
    examples inside it.

    UNIX     /var/www/htdocs/configuration.ini-dist    
             to /var/www/htdocs/configuration.ini
    WINDOWS     C:\phprojekt\htdocs\configuration.ini-dist
             to C:\phprojekt\htdocs\configuration.ini

4. Permission

    Make sure that the webserver or the webserver group can write to the
    tmp/ and to the log directory. You can set these permission using the chmod(1) command.
    Assuming your webserver runs on the group "www-data":

      $ chgrp www-data tmp/
      $ chmod g+w tmp/

5. Finalize

    Enter the site from your browser (see Browser notes in the Notes section of
    this document).
    Log in using the admin user (See Users notes in the Notes section of this
    document). It is suggested to change the password, entering to 'Setting'
    option on the top menu -> Tab 'User' -> Password fields.

DONE
