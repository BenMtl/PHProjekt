    This is the <b>General Help of Gantt module</b><br />
    <br />
    This module is a Gantt chart interface, mouse editable, which is automatically synchronized with the data stored
    in the database.<br />
    <br />
    It reads the Projects and Subprojects and elaborates this graphic that has one horizontal bar per Project
    (timeline) which can be moved with the mouse scrolling it over time or just increasing or decreasing the start and
    end dates.<br />
    <br />
    Up the chart there is a panel &#39;Selected Project Timeline&#39;, when you click on a Project timeline bar, this
    panel's fields get loaded with the start and end dates of it, so that you can see and/or modify them writing a
    different date or selecting a day in the calendar that pops up.<br />
