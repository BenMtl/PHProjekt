$lang["Content Help"]["Basic data"] = "<br/>
    <b>Basic data tab</b><br/>
    <br/>
    Inside this tab it goes the main information about an item.<br/>
    It has several fields to fill, according to the module it belongs to.<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>";

$lang["Content Help"]["Access"] = "<br/>
    <b>Access tab</b><br/>
    <br/>
    This tab allows to establish the individual rights for every user for the item being created or edited.<br/>
    The users that can be worked with, in this tab, are all but the logged one. The aim of this section is to select
    what users do you want to give access to the item, and what kind of access.<br/>
    For example, you create an item and choose some users to give them 'read' access and if you want you can choose
    another user and give him/her 'write' access (apart from the creator that naturally has admin access).<br/>
    <br/>
    The different permissions are:<br/>
    <b>Read:</b> see the item.<br/>
    <b>Write:</b> modify the item.<br/>
    <b>Access:</b> pass through the item (e.g.: see the sub projects but not to see the project itself).<br/>
    <b>Create:</b> create sub items.<br/>
    <b>Copy:</b> copy the item to create other one.<br/>
    <b>Delete:</b> delete the item.<br/>
    <b>Download:</b> download files (for example in the <b>Filemanager</b> module).<br/>
    <b>Admin:</b> allows to do all, including editing the access of the item.<br/>
    <b>None:</b> the user can't even see the item.<br/>
    <br/>
    <u>Note:</u> the owner (creator) of the item has by default all the permissions.<br/>";

$lang["Content Help"]["Notification"] = "<br/>
    <b>Notification tab</b><br/>
    <br/>
    This tab makes possible to send an automatic
    email notification to all the users with read access to the current item, or the users that the current module has
    defined according its own criteria. That email will tell them about the creation or modification of the item
    giving details about it.<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>";

$lang["Content Help"]["History"] = "<br/>
    <b>History tab</b><br/>
    <br/>
    It shows a listing of the changes made to the item since its creation.<br/>
    It has four columns: <i>date</i>, <i>user</i>, <i>field</i> and <i>old value</i>.";
