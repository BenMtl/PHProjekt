$lang["Content Help"]["Basic data"] = "<br />
    <b>Basic data tab</b><br />
    <br />
    Inside this tab it goes the main information about an item.<br />
    It has several fields to fill, according to the module it belongs to.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";

$lang["Content Help"]["Access"] = "<br />
    <b>Access tab</b><br />
    <br />
    Here the individual rights for each item are defined.<br />
    <br />
    The rights are: Read, Write, Access, Create, Copy, Delete, Download and Admin.<br />
    The users that have access to this tab for a specific item, like the owner (creator) of it, can assign these rights
    to other users for this item.<br />
    <br />
    The users that appear in the select list of this tab, that are the ones you can assign rights to, are all the users
    that have access to the parent Project, except for the logged user who is seeing the tab. If you want an unlisted
    user to be listed in the select field, you have to give him/her access to all parent projects.<br />
    The aim of that tab is to select what users you want to give access to the item and what kind of access.<br />
    For example, you create an item and choose some users to give them 'Read' access and if you want you can choose
    another user and give him/her 'Write' access.<br />
    <br />
    The different permissions are:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Read</b>: see the item.<br />
    <b>Write</b>: modify the item.<br />
    <b>Access</b>: pass through the item (e.g.: see the sub projects but not to see the project itself).<br />
    <b>Create</b>: create sub items.<br />
    <b>Copy</b>: copy the item to create other one.<br />
    <b>Delete</b>: delete the item.<br />
    <b>Download</b>: download files (for example in the Filemanager module).<br />
    <b>Admin</b>: allows to do all, including editing the access of the item.<br />
    <br />
    Note: the owner (creator) of the item has by default all the permissions.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";

$lang["Content Help"]["Notification"] = "<br />
    <b>Notification tab</b><br />
    <br />
    This tab makes possible to send an automatic
    email notification to all the users with read access to the current item, or the users that the current module has
    defined according its own criteria. That email will tell them about the creation or modification of the item
    giving details about it.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";

$lang["Content Help"]["History"] = "<br />
    <b>History tab</b><br />
