  * Installation
  * Configuration
  * Notes



Requirements

  * HTTP server
  * MySql (The system has been tested with MySql, but you can try with another SQL server, or even make the appropriate
    fixes and send them to us, so that the next version of PHProjekt supports that server :) )
  * PHP
     + It is needed the appropriate extensions for the server. e.g.: if using MySql, need to have installed the
       PDO_MYSQL extension.

  Note: Phprojekt 6 has been tested with:
  
    * Apache HTTP Server 2.2
    * PHP 5.2.6
    * MySQL Server 5.0


Installation

 1. Download the compressed package file and decompress it into an appropriate folder outside the ones accessed by your
    HTTP server. For example:
    
    UNIX        /var/phprojekt/
    WINDOWS     C:\phprojekt\

 2. Point your server host to the 'htdocs' folder. In the example given, would be:
 
    UNIX        /var/phprojekt/htdocs/
    WINDOWS     C:\phprojekt\htdocs\

 3. Concerning SQL: create a database, could be "phprojekt6".

 4. Locate the following file:
    
    UNIX        /var/phprojekt/docs/blank_database.sql
    WINDOWS     c:\phprojekt\docs\blank_database.sql
    
    It has the SQL queries to create all the tables and to insert the basic data into them. Execute it inside the
    database you created in your server of SQL. Note: the script has been created for MySql, if you are trying with
    another SQL server check that the syntax of the script is compatible.


Configuration

 1. Make a copy of configuration.ini-dist in the same folder, name it configuration.ini and set its
    parameters according to the explanations and examples inside it.
    
    UNIX        /var/phprojekt/htdocs/configuration.ini-dist    -->     /var/phprojekt/htdocs/configuration.ini
    WINDOWS     C:\phprojekt\htdocs\configuration.ini-dist      -->     C:\phprojekt\htdocs\configuration.ini

 2. Enter the site from your browser (see Browser notes in the Notes section of this document).
    Log in using the admin user (See Users notes in the Notes section of this document).
    It is suggested to change the password, entering to 'Setting' option on the top menu -> Tab 'User' -> Password
    fields.
    
 All done! :)
    

Notes

  * BROWSER
    The site has been tested with Firefox (suggested browser) and Internet Explorer.
    You could try it with any other web browser of your choice at your own risk (we would appreciate it if you send us
    fixes, so the site could work OK for that browser of your choice :) ).
  
  * USERS
    
    The database script generates the following users:

    User: admin
    Password: test
    
    User: test
    Password:test
