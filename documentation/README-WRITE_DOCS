At the moment, we have 3 manuals:
  
  Users:     User manual. A basic guide into the features 
             of PHProjekt and how to use them
  Developer: A general guide for external developers. It should
             give a detailed introduction how to write own modules
             and to customize PHProjekt
  Internals: A detailed technical description about the core
             classes, structures and methods of PHProjekt.
             The target audience is the PHProjekt Core Developer Team
             and people who want to change and enhance the basic
             PHProjekt Framework and API.

Every manual is split into chapter. A chapter is represented 
by an directory. Every directory has the format:
 "CHAPTERNUMBER - CHAPTERNAME"
e.g
 "02 Basic Concepts"

You can nest chapters. If the chapternumber is not decided, leave it out.
Articles have exactly the same format except for being text files and not
directories.

The format of the article:
  A section is separated from another one by 2 or more blank lines.
  You can use a BBCode like syntax to specify special sections.
  
  [emph]emphasis[/emph]: 	Text is emphasized
  [code]class foobar {}[/code]: Text is displayed as a code fragment
  [bold]text is bold[/bold]:    Text is written bold. Prefer emph if possible
