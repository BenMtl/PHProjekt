After we setup our database table, we have to create the module directory.
We switch into the application/ directory of PHProjekt
and create a directory called WorkingHours/.
Furthermore we create the directories View/, Controllers/ and Models/.

[code]
/application
  /WorkingHours
    /Controllers
    /Models
    /Views
[/code]

This layout is necessary.
PHProjekt uses a MVC pattern and the names of the subdirectories cannot be changed.
Make sure that Controllers/, Models/ and Views/ start with an uppercase letter.
The directory access (correct: on most of the operating systems, but not all) is case-sensitiv.
