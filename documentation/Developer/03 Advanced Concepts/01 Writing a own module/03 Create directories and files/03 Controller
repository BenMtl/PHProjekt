Now we need a controller for manage the actions.

As the model, we need only to extend the default, so we create the file IndexController.php

Filename: application/WorkingHours/Controllers/IndexController.php

[code]
<?php
/**
 * Manage actions
 *
 * @copyright 2007 PHProjekt development team
 */
class WorkingHours_IndexController extends IndexController
{
}
[/code]

This file will use all the functions defined by default.
