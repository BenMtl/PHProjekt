In the following chapter, we want to start writing code.
We are going to write a mechanism to track our daily working hours. 

We just want to have a button. If we click on the button, we start tracking the time.
If we click another time, we stop tracking the time.
Furthermore we want to display how many hours we worked this month
and we want to select project to book our time on, before we start tracking.

We use the a SQL database to store our data.
In particular we are going to use MySQL syntax.
We also use Smarty templates to display our calculated times.

Our first step will be the creation of a database table that stores our data.
After that we start creating the necessary directory structure for a module.
Then we start writing code by creating a mapping from our database table into PHP.
If we finished with that, we are going to design our frontend
and then putting all together in the controller - catching the users actions.

Before we start, please consider to read the Zend Coding Guidelines first.
We are using some shortcuts that you should probably avoid in your module
(we will left out a lot of the necessary documentation headers).
