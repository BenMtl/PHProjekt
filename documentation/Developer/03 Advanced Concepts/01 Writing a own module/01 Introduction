In the following chapter, we want to start writing code.
We are going to write a mechanism to track our daily working hours.

We just want to have a form with start and end dates, and start and end times.
Also for wich project we want to track the time.

We use the a SQL database to store our data.
In particular we are going to use MySQL syntax.
We also use Javascript and Dojo templates to display our calculated times.

Our first step will be the creation of a database table that stores our data.
After that we start creating the necessary directory structure for a module.
Then we start writing code by creating a mapping from our database table into PHP.
If we finished with that, we are going to design our frontend
and then putting all together in the controller - catching the users actions.

Before we start, please consider to read the Zend Coding Guidelines first.
We are using some shortcuts that you should probably avoid in your module
(we will left out a lot of the necessary documentation headers).

All these steps are the "hard way", if you want to make it really easy,
just login as admin, go to the Administration => Module => Add,
and here you can easy draw and drop the fields, set them,
and the API will do the rest of the job.
Later for sure, you can customize it.
