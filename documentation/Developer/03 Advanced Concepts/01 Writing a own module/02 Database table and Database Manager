The first thing that has to be done is creating our database tables.
We use our favorite tool to create the following table:

(We are using foreign keys here.
If you use MySQL, make sure that PHProjekt was installed using
InnoDB tables and that you create the example table using InnoDB.
If necessary specifiy ENGINE=InnoDB)

[code]
CREATE TABLE `WorkingHours` (
  `id`        INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `startDate` DATETIME NOT NULL,
  `endDate`   DATETIME NOT NULL,
  `projectId` INT,
  PRIMARY KEY(id),
  FOREIGN KEY(projectId)   -- don't use this part if you don't use mysql with innodb
  REFERENCES project(id) 
  ON DELETE SET NULL
);
[/code]

Thats everthing we need from our database. Let's pass over and create our necessary files.
