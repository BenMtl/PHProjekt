If you want to produce a customized layout that is not
based on the default tree, list, form layout, that PHProjekt
provides by default you need to modify the rendering mechanism
of PHProjekt.

The default rendering mechanism of PHProjekt can be found
in the _generateOutput method of the IndexController that 
is called by the postDispatch method, after any call
to the controller actions was done.

The default mechanism renders the index.tpl from the
modules template directory or the default index.tpl 
in case that you don't provide a module specific 
index.tpl. The default index.tpl includes
the renderer templates for trees (tree.tpl),
forms (form.tpl) and list (list.tpl). If you need
to overwrite just one of those, don't overwrite the
index.tpl but instead, overwrite the template itself.

To customize the output write your own index.tpl and 
put it into the template directory.
In your modules IndexController overwrite the
_generateOutput method. You can use the
API provided by the zend framework to set and
render the template. 

Please read the Zend Framework Manual for more 
information about the view component.

e.g:
[code]
class FooIndexController extends IndexController
{
	/*
	...... actions, etc
	*/

	public function _generateOutput()
	{
		$this->view->myVarName = 'test';
		$this->render('index');
	}
}
[/code]
