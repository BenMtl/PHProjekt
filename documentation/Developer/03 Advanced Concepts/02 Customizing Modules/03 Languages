In the folder Languages, there are all the translation files, one per language.

If your module have special strings, you must add them into the languages files in order to be translated.

On one string to be translated, the system will looking for:

First, in the module, in the current language file, if the string is not found,
Second, in the Default module, in the current language file, if the string is not found,
Third, show the string without translation.

All the strings in the code, so all the index strings in the languages file, ARE IN ENGLISH.
That is important, since if the translation is not found, the untranslated text is showed,
so the english text will be seen.

Since all the tranaslations are cached at the first time in two files,
if you change something in the languages file, please delete these cache file, for see the changes.
Also you will need to logout and login again, for reload the translations.
The cache files are:

tmp/zendCache/zend_cache---Phprojekt_getTranslate_en
and
tmp/zendCache/zend_cache---Phprojekt_LanguageAdapter_loadTranslationData_en

Look the end of the files (_en), are the cache files for ALL the en.inc.php languages files of all the modules.
If you change one string in other language, like de, the files will be:

tmp/zendCache/zend_cache---Phprojekt_getTranslate_de
and
tmp/zendCache/zend_cache---Phprojekt_LanguageAdapter_loadTranslationData_de
