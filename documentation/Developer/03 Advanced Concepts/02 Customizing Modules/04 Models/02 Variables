The Phprojekt_Item_Abstract have 2 variables, for use in the search.

[emph]public $searchFirstDisplayField = 'title'[emph]

This will be the first field for use to display the search values of the module.
By default is "title", but if your module don't have a title field, you must change that to other field.

[emph]public $searchSecondDisplayField = 'notes'[/emph]

This will be the second field for use to display the search values of the module.
By default is "notes", but if your module don't have a notes field, you must change that to other field.

[emph]public $hasMany[/emph]
[emph]public $hasManyAndBelongsToMany[/emph]
[emph]public $belongsTo[/emph]

This variables provide the relations between the module and other modules.
For example, in the Project module, there is the relation:

[code]
public $hasMany = array('modulePermissions' => array('classname' => 'Project_Models_ProjectModulePermissions'));
[/code]

This relation say that for each project value, there are many values in the project_module_permissions table.
For an extend documentation about these variables, please see the Phprojekt_ActiveRecord_Abstract documentation.
