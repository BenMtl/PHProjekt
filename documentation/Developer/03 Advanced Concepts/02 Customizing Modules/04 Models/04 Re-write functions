As we already see, all the models implements with Phprojekt_Model_Interface have the function:

[emph]public function getInformation()[/emph]
[emph]public function find()[/emph]
[emph]public function fetchAll()[/emph]
[emph]public function save()[/emph]
[emph]public function recordValidate()[/emph]
[emph]public function getRights()[/emph]

If your module needs that, you can re-write these functions for work in other way that the default.
Some examples:

[emph]public function getInformation()[/emph]

This function in the Phprojekt_Item_Abstract, returns the Phprojekt_DatabaseManager class,
that provide the data of all the fields from the table database_manager.
If your module don't use this table, you can return other class that return the fields and all the data needed.
You can see examples of that in modules like Timecard and Minutes.
The Timecard is not an item, and have their own information manager.
The minutes is an item, but have a sub-module with a own information manager.

[emph]public function find()[/emph]

If your module is a Phprojekt_Item_Abstract, is not recommend to overwrite this function.

[emph]public function save()[/emph]

The Phprojekt_Item_Abstract::save make some stuff, like save the history, the values for search, and rights.
One example of a re-write for this function, is in the case that your module DON'T need these stuff.
You can see an example of that in the Contact module.
Other example is if you need to do extra stuff after the save, like the Project module does (delete the tree cache).

[emph]public function recordValidate()[/emph]

This function is often re-written since each module have special ways for validate their data.
You can create validates functions for each field or re-write this function for validate all the values together.

[emph]public function getRights()[/emph]

If your module is a Phprojekt_Item_Abstract, is not recommend to overwrite this function.

[emph]Other functions for Phprojekt_Item_Abstract.[/emph]

[emph]public function fetchAll($where = null, $order = null, $count = null, $offset = null, $select = null,
$join = null)[/emph]

Is not recommend to overwrite this function, but in some cases, where you don't need the rights system,
you can re-write the fetchAll for make a simple query.
You can see an example of that in the Contact module.

[emph]public function saveRights()[/emph]

Is not recommend to overwrite this function, but in some cases, where you don't need the rights system,
you can re-write the saveRights for do nothing.
You can see an example of that in the Contact module.

[emph]public function delete()[/emph]

The Phprojekt_Item_Abstract::delete make some stuff, like save the history, delete the values for search,
and delete rights.
One example of a re-write for this function, is in the case that your module DON'T need these stuff.
You can see an example of that in the Contact module.
