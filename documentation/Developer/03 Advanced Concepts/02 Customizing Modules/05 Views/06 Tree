A basic module will have in the Tree.js file:

[code]
dojo.provide("phpr.MyModule.Tree");

dojo.declare("phpr.MyModule.Tree", phpr.Default.Tree, {
});
[/code]

This is the obligatory code for the file and you don't must re-write any function of it.
Since the Tree is the same for all the modules (The project tree),
must work in the same way in all the places.
