The basic structure of the View folder is like:

[code]
/application
    /Module
        /Views
            /dojo
                /scripts
                    /template
                    Form.js
                    Grid.js
                    Main.js
                    Tree.js
                index.phtml
                login.phtml
                mailHtml.phtml
                mailText.phtml
                upload.phtml
[/code]

In the default modules, the template folder don't exists since they use the default templates,
and all the .js files are just empty extensions of the Default .js files.
The template folder can not exists, but the .js MUST be there,
since the javascript needs to load them for run the module.

index.phtml is the file used for render all the page always, just setup the javascript and call the main js function.
login.phtml is the file used for render the login page.
upload.phtml is the file used for render upload field in the forms.
This files are only under the Default module.

The other two files:
mailHtml.phtml and mailText.phtml, render the mail for send in a notification.
Each module can have their own templates for that.
