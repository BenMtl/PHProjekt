[emph]public function init()[/emph]

The function checks if it is a logged user
and then sets up the helper and cleans all the variables.
This is the first function executed before each other action.
If you want to add something before each function is called,
this is the correct place, the code can be something like:

[code]
public function init()
{
   parent::init();
   my_function();
}
[/code]

Is important that you don't change this function, just extend it.

[emph]public function indexAction()[/emph]

The function sets up the template index.phtml and render it.
If you want to add a new variable into the index.phtml template, you should do it here.
You must to re-write the function for that.

[emph]public function getModelObject()[/emph]

Gets the class model of the module or the default one.
In general you don't need to re-write this function, at least that your module
must return the model in other way.

[emph]public function setParams()[/emph]

Sets some values depending on the parameters.
Re-write this function if your module needs some changes on the parameters,
before send it into the save function.
Sometimes you need to add extra parameters, or just change it depend on some values.
Use this function for that.
