There are some text constant that are used for the messages.
This constants should not be changed, just change the text in your language file,
but is recommended to use them instead of the text message directly,
since they give support for several languages.

These constant are:
- ADD_TRUE_TEXT
- EDIT_TRUE_TEXT
- EDIT_MULTIPLE_TRUE_TEXT
- DELETE_TRUE_TEXT
- DELETE_FALSE_TEXT
- DELETE_MULTIPLE_TRUE_TEXT
- NOT_FOUND
- ID_REQUIRED_TEXT
