PHProjekt is a web based groupware application that helps you in managing project,
tasks, contacts and other data.
It is written in PHP and distributed under the GNU Public License (GPL).
PHProjekt was originally developed by Albrecht Günther in 1999
and is developed by the Mayflower GmbH since version 5.0.
With the beginning of the PHProjekt 6.0 development cycle the complete project was rewritten. 

The following documentation gives you an idea about the internals of PHProjekt 6.0.
It will introduce the MVC based application design,
the module concept and the active record pattern,
which helps you to receive data from a database backend,
as well as several other techniques used in PHProjekt 6.0. 

It's considered as the official developer documentation,
but not as the introduction to the PHProjekt API internals.
