Starting from version 6.0,
PHProjekt provides an flexible rapid development framework
that allows you to easily extend the application with your own code. 

In general PHProjekt 6.0 is divided into multiple modules that provide certain features.
A module might be e.g. the task modules which provides the user the possibility to manage tasks.
Other modules are e.g. the contact or the calendar module. 

Every module is splitted into a model, a controller and a view part.
This design pattern is called MVC. 

To get data from a module, you will usually use the active record pattern,
which helps you with mapping database tables into PHP objects.
