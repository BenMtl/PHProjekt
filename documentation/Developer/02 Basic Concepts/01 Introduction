Starting from version 6.0.

PHProjekt provides an flexible rapid development framework that allows you to easily extend the application
with your own code.

PHProjekt 6.0 is divided into multiple modules that provide certain features.
A module might be e.g. the task modules which provides the user the possibility to manage tasks.
Other modules are e.g. the contact or the calendar module.

Every module is splitted into a model, a controller and a view part.
This design pattern is called MVC.
There also a sql and a language part.

The first important concept is: [emph]"Each module must provide everything for manage the module"[/emph]

To get data from a module, you will usually use the active record pattern, which helps you with mapping
database tables into PHP objects.
