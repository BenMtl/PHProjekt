The decision, which controller and which method of this controller is called, is made by the Zend Dispatcher.
This class maps a url e.g. http://example.com/index./list/1 to an controller.
If you want to know, how the dispatcher works, and which mappings it provides,
please read the Zend Framework Documentation on http://framework.zend.com.
PHProjekt uses a special way of mapping.

As an example, the url: http://myphprojekt.com/index.php/Projects/index/list is mapped to the IndexController
of the Project module.
The class will be instantiated by the dispatcher and then the listAction() method will be called.
Therefore the first part, after the index.php, in this case Projects is the name of the module thats called.
The second part of the url, is the controller name.
The index will refer to a IndexController class, as foo would refer to FooController.
As you can see, the suffix Controller is appended.
The last part is the name of the method thats called.
The string “Action” is appended to the given name.
In our case not the method list() is called, but the method listAction() is called.
Every additional part, seperated by an /, would be mapped into the post variables array
and therefore can be access through $_POST or (better) the Zend_Request object.

So the url http://myprojekt.com/index.php/Projects/index/list/id/2/ will be have the request array:

[code]
array(
    "id" => 2
)
[/code]
