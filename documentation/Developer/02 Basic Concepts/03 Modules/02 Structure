Every module is a directory located in the application/ directory.
The directory name is the table name used for the module but with initial letter capitalized
(The table nane is always in lowercase).

The module directory has five subdirectories.
The Controllers/ directory, the Languages/ directory, the Models/ directory,
the Sql directory, and the Views/ directory
Please notice that directory names are case-sensitiv.

[code]
/application
  /MyModule
    /Controllers
    /Languages
    /Models
    /Sql
    /Views
[/code]

The controller classes, derived from the IndexController class, are located in the Controller/ directory.
They start with a name and end with the suffix Controller.
A valid controller name would be e.g.: IndexController or FormController.
If nothing else is specified, the dispatcher class will always call the IndexController.
See chapter the section called “Mapping of controllers” for further details about calling controllers.

The Languages folder contain the files for translate all the strings used by the module.
The names of the files are xx.inc.php, where xx define the language,
e.g.: en.inc.php is for English trasnlation.
The files have just an array of strings, where the index is the english phrase, and the value is the trasnlation.
e.g.: for german, $lang["User List"] = "Benutzer-Liste"

The model classes are located in Models/.
They must have the format Modulename_Models_Modelname.
A valid model name would be e.g.: WorkingHours_Models_WorkingHour or Files_Models_Directory.
Every model must inherite the Phprojekt_Model_Interface class.

The Sql folder contain the Db.json file,
that provide the SQL structure, initial and extra data of the module in JSON format.

In the Views/ diretory you can place directories for each view that you want,
inside it, you can place PHP files that render output.
Usually you are layouting the JavaScript components there,
but the developer is free and responsable to do what ever he wants there,
as long as there is no business logic there.
