Every module is a directory located in the application/ directory.
The directory name is usually the module name, but must not.
The module directory has three subdirectories.
The Views/ directory, the Models/ directory and the Controllers/ directory.
Please notice that directory names are case-sensitiv. 

[code]
/application
  /MyModule
    /Controllers
    /Models
    /Views
[/code]

The controller classes, derived from the IndexController class,
are located in the Controller/ directory.
They start with a name and end with the suffix Controller.
A valid controller name would be e.g.: IndexController or FormController.
If nothing else is specified, the dispatcher class will always call the IndexController.
See chapter the section called “Mapping of controllers” for further details about calling controllers. 

The model classes are located in Models/.
They must have the format Modulename_Models_Modelname.
A valid model name would be e.g.: WorkingHours_Models_WorkingHour or Files_Models_Directory.
Every model must inherite the Phprojekt_Model_Interface class.

In the Views/ diretory you can place PHP files that render output.
Usually you are layouting the JavaScript components there,
but the developer is free and responsable to do what ever he wants there,
as long as there is no business logic there.
