Modules are a core part of PHProjekt.
They constist of a set of features, that are related to each other.
E.g. managing tasks or managing appointments are combined into a module.
Modules have a specific directory layout. 

Every module is displayed on a per-project base.
This means, that a e.g. the task module is displayed if you click on a project at the project tree.
Therefore data saved by a model is usually related to a project id, but need't to.

PHProjekt provides a default module.
Every module in PHProjekt uses those parts of the default module automaticly,
that are not overwritten by own written code.
