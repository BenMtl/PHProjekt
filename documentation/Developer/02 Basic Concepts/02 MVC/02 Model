The model part receives data from a datasource.
Usually the datasource is a database connection.
The model part must take care that the data from the database is received
and mapped into an PHP object (an instance of a class).
In the application all data is manipulated using this objects.
No direct SQL statements are executed outside the model part
(Except for the core API. Core classes are also allowed to do a query themself).

A model might also map other data into objects, for example a web service.

Every model in PHProjekt is derived from Phprojekt_Model_Interface and must implement the required methods:
- public function getInformation()
- public function find()
- public function fetchAll()
- public function save()
- public function recordValidate()
- public function getRights()
In general, all the modules are extensions of Phprojekt_Item_Abstract that already have all this functions.
Please look at the API documentation for detailed information.
