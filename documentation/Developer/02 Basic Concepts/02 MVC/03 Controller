The controller combines the model and the view part of a module.
It receives the actions from a user, e.g. updating a dataset,
and then receiving the data using the model,
manipulating it and display the result using the view.
It controls all other parts.

For send the data to the view, is used the JSON format, for example:
{}&&([{"id":1,"name":"Project1"),{"id":2,"name":"Project2")]}
