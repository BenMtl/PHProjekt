Being a Component the phpr.Default.Form class extends the phpr.Component class.

On construction this class receives all the Details which are needed for rendering the form from the Server and stores
them in a phpr.CompleteReadStore.

On fetching the content of this store the phpr.Default.Form class automatically renders the data in the right format.

In order to do so it starts with rendering the content of the different tabs provided in our store. It relies on the type 
which is given in the metadata of the store to determine which kind of field is rendered at a time. Depending on
the current fields type the corresponding html template is rendered by using the render function of the phpr.Component
class.

After rendering all fields within a tab the tab itself is rendered with the help of the render function and finally
all tabs are rendered within the "detailsBox" div.

In addition to rendering the Form template the phpr.Default.Form class is also responsible for sending the data of the
form to the server. 
In order to do so the Form connects the onClick event of the submitForm Button to phpr.Default.Form.submitForm method which automatically
receives all changed data from the form and sends them via post to the Server.
