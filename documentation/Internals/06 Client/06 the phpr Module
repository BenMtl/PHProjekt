In the dojo understanding we only provide one customized dojo Module within our Client which is called phpr.
Using a dojo Module for our Client source code allows us to keep our code separated from the dojo code.
A Dojo Module provides us with our own Namespace for the PHProjekt specific scripts and we don't need
to worry about overwriting existing dojo classes.

All PHProjekt Modules like Project, Todo etc. are what dojo would call submodules. 

The Main purpose of the phpr.js is to initialize the new Module phpr and to register the path to this Module relative
to the dojo.js Script.

This is done by dojo.registerModulePath("phpr", "../../phpr");

Besides that the phpr Script provides some Basic methods which we will need within most of the submodules.

[emph]phpr.initWidgets[/emph]
This method automatically parses our new widgets.
Everytime you render your own widgets make sure to call this method, so that you don't need to parse the new
widget manually.

[emph]phpr.destroyWidgets[/emph]
This method destroy all widgets underneath a certain DomNode.
That function is needed when you need to reload certain widgets, because you can only
load each widget ID once. So make sure you destroy a widget before rendering it again.

[emph]phpr.send[/emph]
This method sends a given Object to the server.
It allows you to specify the content to be send, the server url,
and customized functions which are called after the content was successfully send or an error occured while sending.

[emph]phpr.getData[/emph]
This methods receives data from the server and allows you to process the data in a custom callback function

[emph]phpr.MetaReadStore and phpr.CompleteReadStore[/emph]
Those two Submodules of the phpr Module both extend the dojox.data.QueryReadStore.
The Store is needed to provide the data for many dojo widgets, like the Grid widget for example.

The difference between the phpr.MetaReadStore and the phpr.CompleteReadStore is that the MetaReadStore
only stores the metadata which it receives from the Server in Json format, whereas the CompleteReadStore
stores both the metadata and data.
