Index:

The index is doit by the Item Phprojekt_Item_Abstract class on the save().

The class will find all the words in the text fields.
If any field is a file, the class will read the file and get all the words in it.

Search:

The search is doit on the front, using the jsonSearchAction like that:

Default/Search/jsonSearch/words/$words/operator/$operator

Where $words are some words for search separated by spaces,
and $operator can be "AND", "OR", or null (by default, is "AND").

The return value for the search, will be an array like that:

array('moduleId'      => 1,
      'moduleName'    => 'Project',
      'id'            => 2,
      'firstDisplay'  => 'title string',
      'secondDisplay' => 'note string');

One row per found result.
The id is the itemId, and the firstDisplay and secondDisplay
are some data of the item.
For define which data of the item will show the seach, there are 2 vars:

public $searchFirstDisplayField
public $searchSecondDisplayField

By default the Phprojekt_Item_Abstract have the vars setted to 'title' and 'notes'.
But each model can rewrite it if have other fields or want to show other data.
