Migration notes

It is possible to migrate the database from PHProjekt 5.x to PHProjekt 6 providing the real path to the PHProjekt 5.x config.inc.php (e.g. /var/www/html/config.inc.php or C:\www\phprojekt\config.inc.php). The config.inc.php needs to be on the same server where you are installing PHProjekt 6.

The migration could take several minutes depending on the number of projects to be migrated.

Important: User passwords will not be migrated. All migrated users will have the same username and password.

Root user will not be migrated, because it is replaced by 'admin' user on PHProjekt6.

The modules to be migrated are: Calendar, Projects, Notes, Todos, Timeproj, Timecard and Filemanager.

Customized module fields will not be migrated.

If Filemanager files does not work after migration please try moving manually the uploaded files (e.g. move the files on /phprojekt5.x/uploads to /phprojekt6/uploads).
