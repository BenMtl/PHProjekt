Possible errors when creating or modifying a module and how to solve them.

[emph]The Module must contain at least one field[/emph]

If this error appears, you tried to save an empty module. Enter the module designer and check that at least one field is
in any of the available tabs in the right section of the designer.


[emph]Please enter a name for this module[/emph]

This error is thrown when you try to save a module leaving the 'Label' Form field blank. Just give it a name and press
Save again.


[emph]The module name must start with a letter[/emph]

This error is shown when you don't use a letter at the beginning of module's label. Just replace first character by a
letter and click on Save again.


[emph]Invalid parameters[/emph]

General error pointing that something is wrong with the filled data of Module designer -> Editing left bottom panel ->
Table tab. Check its values for every field and try to Save the module again.


[emph]All the fields must have a table name[/emph]

This error appears when not all the fields have a Field Name in Module designer -> Editing left bottom panel -> Table 
tab -> Field name. Check that value for every field and try to Save the module again.


[emph]There are two fields with the same Field Name[/emph]

This error is shown when there is a repeated Field Name in Module designer -> Editing left bottom panel -> Table tab -> 
Field Name. Check that value for each field until you find and solve the repeated name and try to Save the module again.


[emph]The length of the varchar fields must be between 1 and 255[/emph]

If this error appears it points that a field has been configured as Varchar and was set a length lower than 1 or higher
than 255 so it doesn't respect the allowed range. Look for the field and change the value in Module designer -> Editing
left bottom panel -> Table tab -> Table Length.


[emph]The length of the int fields must be between 1 and 11[/emph] 

This error appears when a field has been configured as Int and was set a length lower than 1 or higher than 11 so it 
doesn't respect the allowed range. Look for the field and change the value in Module designer -> Editing left bottom
panel -> Table tab -> Table Length.


[emph]Invalid form Range for the select field[/emph]

Error shown when a field of type Select box has empty the Range value in Module designer -> Editing left bottom panel ->
Form tab -> Range. This value is filled automatically when selected an item in Table tab -> Select Type field. E.g.: for
Projects the Range value is 'Project#id#title'. Anyway, you can modify it.


[emph]The module must have a project selector called project_id[/emph]

When you are creating or editing a Normal module (Form -> Type = Normal) and you have deleted the Project selector in
the module designer this error points you that it is needed to put it again in any of the tabs in the right section of
the designer. This is because all items of the Normal modules depend on a specific Project.
