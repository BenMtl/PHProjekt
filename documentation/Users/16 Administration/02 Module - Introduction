[emph]Introduction[/emph]

The Module Designer is a very easy-to-use visual drag & drop interface to create modules and maybe modify the already
existing ones.

Firstly you press the add button or select an existing module from the Grid. Then the Form shows the label field and 
permits you to choose whether it is currently active or not (whether it is shown in the system).

Pressing the Open Dialog button a pop-up window appears showing the designer itself. See 'Module - Designer' section of 
this help.

    
[emph]Scope of editable modules[/emph]

This sub-module called 'Module' permits creating simple modules without extraordinary functionalities, also editing 
them. 

There are some existing modules like Gantt, Timecard and Statistic which can't get its fields and tabs contents
modified, if you click on any of them in the Grid, the Form won't show Open Dialog button.
In addition to this, it is not recommended to modify the rest of modules that come with the system. Most of them have 
additional and special functionalities that were not made with the Module Designer and could stop working if modified.
Calendar, Helpdesk and many others have special behavior that can't be configured from the designer, it's a developer 
task.


[emph]Notes[/emph]

* All modules created from here will be added the Access, Notification and History tabs.
