Note: 
Due to this module being a delicate part of the system, the grid does not allow to change its contents, you have to use
the Form instead.

The Grid has the common fields like pencil and Id (not checkbox), also there are:

[emph]Name[/emph]

Text: the name of the module. This name will only be seen here (not in the Form). It's not important.


[emph]Label[/emph]

Text: the name that will be shown for the module when no translation is available. The translation can't be added here,
it's a developer task.


[emph]Type[/emph]

Select: Normal or Global, whether this module is Project-module or Global one.
If Normal, the module will need a Project field and it (the module) will be seen in the central tab bar.
If Global, the module won't need a Project field and it will be seen on top right module bar.
See 'Global and Project Modules Navigation' section of General User help.


[emph]Active[/emph]

Select: Yes / No. Whether this module will currently be seen and active or not.
