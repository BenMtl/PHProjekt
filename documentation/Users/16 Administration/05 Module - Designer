The Module Designer opened when clicked 'Open Dialog' Form button has 3 panels / sections:

[emph]Left fields panel[/emph]

Here all the field types are located; text, date, time, select, checkbox, percentage, textarea and upload. This is a
repository where you can drag & drop fields to the right panel, that right panel is the tab of the module you are 
creating or modifying as it will be seen (except for Tag field after the last field that isn't seen in the designer).
The Edit button in the right side of the fields permits modifying its data before adding them to the module tab (right 
panel) although it is also possible to drag and drop them first and then edit them pressing that button in the right 
panel.


[emph]Right tabs panel[/emph]

This one has the main tabs of the module the way they are going to be seen when you open it outside the Module Designer 
(except for Tag field after the last field that isn't seen here). You add fields dragging and dropping them from the 
left panel, then pressing Edit button the edit panel is opened in the left bottom part of the window so that you can 
configure the field.
The fields can be reordered with drag & drop method and deleted from the tab dragging & dropping them back to the left 
panel or just pressing Delete button at the right side of them.
There are as many tabs in this panel as tabs are defined in module Administration, sub-module Tab.
You don't need to use all the tabs created. The tab will appear in the final module only if there are fields inside it.


[emph]Left bottom editing panel[/emph]

At the bottom left of the screen, when it is pressed the Edit button of a field, a window appears to modify its values 
and parameters. The most of the values are already filled but you can change them. It is very important that all filled
values are correct. When you finish making changes here press the Check button to close it.
It has 4 tabs:

TABLE: to set the data of the table of the database for this field. Contents:

  Field Name: the name that the field will have in the database table.
  
  Field Type: depending on the type of the field selected you will have different options here. If it only has one 
    option don't change it but in the case of Text and Select field types you can choose whether the field for the
    module you are editing it will contain characters and numbers (Varchar) or just allow numbers (INT).
  
  Table Length: this field is not always shown, it represents the maximum amount of characters, no more than 255 for 
    Varchar or 11 for Int.
  
  Select Type: this field is only shown for Select type fields. Those fields show values for the user to pick one of 
    them. You can choose whether you want to take those values from a specific table contents or provide Custom Values.
    On the one hand, if you select here Project, Users or Contacts, the field Range from Form tab inside this bottom 
    left editor will get filled automatically with 'Project#id#title', this value means <table>#<key>#<label> so that 
    the field inside the module you are editing will allow the user to select a Project title (<table>=Projects, 
    <label>='title' field) and will save the selected Id (<key>) in the database module table.
    On the other hand, if you select 'Custom values' here, then the field Range from Form tab will allow you to use the 
    same system (<table>#<key>#<label>) with other table, or the alternative system 'key1#label1|key2#label2|etc' for 
    you to provide a series of values that are independent from any table. E.g.: '1#black|2#blue|3#yellow', the field
    you are editing (the one you clicked Edit inside the tab) will show in this case three colors for the user to choose 
    one of them, according to the selected color the respective number will be saved in the database, the numbers won't
    be seen in the list.     
  
FORM: to edit the data shown in the form. Contents:
  
  Label: the name that will be shown for the field when no translation is available. The translation can't be added 
    here, it's a developer task.
  
  Range: explained in 'Select Type' part of 'TABLE' here above, only available for 'Select' fields.
  
  Default Value: the default value shown when the user creates an item.
  
LIST: to edit whether the field is shown in the list or not, and its position inside it. Contents:

  List Position: this refers to the Grid, if 0 is set then the field won't be shown, if 1 or higher, then it will be
    shown and the number is the position from left to right after the Id column.
  
GENERAL: general parameters. Contents:

  Status: whether the field will be used in the module or not, maybe to temporarily delete fields. 
  
  Required Field: whether the field is a required one or you can leave it empty when you edit an item in the Grid or the 
    Form.

 
 
[emph]Notes[/emph]


1 - When finished editing the tabs and fields press Close button to close this pop-up and return to the Form.

2 - Other special tabs:
There are other tabs used in the system modules that are not defined here, nor could be modified. They depend on the 
module you are working with and were created using programming techniques:
* General modules: tabs Access, Notification and History. All the modules created with the Module designer will have, 
  apart from the tabs designed by the user, these 3 tabs explained in the General section of User help. History will 
  only be shown in edit mode.
* Project module: tabs Module and Role.
* Calendar module: tab Recurrence.
* Minute module: People, Items and Mail.

3 - There can be dragged back right panel fields to the left panel. This is useful to take them back later to the right 
panel or to move them to another right panel tab.
