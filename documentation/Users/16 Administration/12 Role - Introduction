[emph]Introduction[/emph]

This tab permits managing the Roles.

A Role is a specific set of permissions for each module. That Role is assigned to users of the Project you want, so 
that they will have those rights for the modules associated with that Project. When you create or edit a Project, you 
can give every different user that Role inside Role tab.
The final right for a specific user to work with an item is defined by the conjunction of the permissions defined both 
inside Role and Access tabs of the parent Project module.

By default, no Role is assigned to anybody, and the permission to access to a new project will be Admin access for the 
creator and nothing for the rest.


[emph]Example[/emph]

You can create a Role called 'Can read TODOs and NOTEs'.
Then set inside the Form Read access to Todo and Note modules.
Then you create a Project and assign the user 'john' the Role 'Can read TODOs and NOTEs', so when he enters the Project,
the only thing he will be able to do apart from reading the main data of the Project itself is to read (but not modify) 
items of Todo and Note modules.

* For a detailed example about Roles and permissions go to 'Permissions example' section of 'Project' chapter of User 
help.


[emph]Notes[/emph]

* Look at the listing of modules that you select to assign rights to a role: the Project module represents the 
Subprojects of the Project you assign the Role to.

* For detailed info about Roles and permissions go to 'Permissions' and 'Permissions example' sections of 'Project'
chapter of User help.

* Role Id 1 'Admin in all' can't be deleted.
