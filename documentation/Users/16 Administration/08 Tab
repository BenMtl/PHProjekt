[emph]Introduction[/emph]

This sub-module permits creating tabs to add them to the modules using the Module designer.

You will have 'Basic Data' tab plus user created ones.
All tabs available here are the ones that will be shown in the right section of the Module Designer.
Anyway, the modules will have only the tabs that you dragged fields to, in the Module Designer, so here you can create
as many tabs as you want and then just use the ones you want on each module.
E.g.: you can create an extra tab 'Geographic Info' and create a module with the Module designer. If you just drag & 
drop fields to the 'Basic Data' tab and nothing to the 'Geographic Info' tab, then the second tab won't be seen in the
module. See 'Module - Designer' section of User help for more info.


[emph]Grid[/emph]

The Grid has the Pencil, Id and Label columns.
Label is a text field having the name that will be shown for the tab when no translation is available. The translation 
can't be added here, it's a developer task.


[emph]Form[/emph]

The Form only has Label field.
Label is a text field having the name that will be shown for the tab when no translation is available. The translation 
can't be added here, it's a developer task.


[emph]Other special tabs[/emph]

There are other tabs used in the system modules that are not defined here, nor could be modified.

    * General modules: tabs Access, Notification and History.
      All the modules created with the Module designer will have, apart from the tabs designed by the user, these 3 tabs 
      explained in the help of most of the modules. History will only be shown in edit mode.
    * Project module: tabs Module and Role.
    * Calendar module: tab Recurrence.
    * Minute module: People, Items and Mail tabs.
