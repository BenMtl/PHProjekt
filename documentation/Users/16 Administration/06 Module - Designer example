[emph]How to create a module, from zero[/emph]

1. Assuming you are in the Module tab of Administration module, press Add button.

2. An empty form appears. Write the name of the new module in the Label textbox. Leave Type in 'Normal' and Active in
   'Yes'.

3. Press the Open Dialog button. A big pop-up window containing the module designer appears.
   You will see two big panels: one at the left and one at the right side, plus an empty space in the left bottom where 
   the field editing window will appear.
   Inside the right panel there is a Project select box. That field should exist if this is a 'Normal' type module for 
   it to work, it is the relation between the item and the Projects.

4. Add to the right panel using drag & drop a field of your choice. If there is more than one tab in the right panel, 
   you can select the tab you want previous to the drag & drop to set the field there. In both cases, after dropping it 
   the editing window appears for you to configure the field.
   Note: to drop the field, you have to position it with the mouse over a place where the floating box that you are 
   dragging converts itself from reddish pink to green color; that color means that you are able to drop the field 
   there, because it's up or behind another field.

5. Configure the field attending to each of the 4 tabs of the editing window as explained in 'Module - Designer' section
   of this help.

6. Repeat the steps 5 and 6 as many times as fields you want to add.

7. Arrange the fields in the right panel in the order you want using drag & drop.

8. Press the Close button in the left bottom of the window.

9. The pop-up window has been closed. Press Save and the module creation is finished. The saving process, when creating 
   a module, creates the table in the database, saves the parameters and creates the structure of folders and files.
