The Calendar is a very complete module for managing events. You can create an event, set descriptive info to it, assign 
it date and time, specify participants, create a particular recurrence for the event, and the rest of things common to 
most of modules like mail Notification and History registry.
The created event will appear, apart from the owner's one, inside each participant's calendar and they will be able to 
open it and see its contents.

An event may last more than one day.


[emph]Views[/emph]

There are four types of views that are activated through the tabs over the button bar and Grid: List, Day, Week and 
Month, all views are located in the same space, so you only can use one at a time.
There are one or two tabs at the left of these 4 view tabs: Self and Selection. Self is always there and means that the 
listing shows 'self' data, the logged user events. Selection tab currently only appears when 'Day' is the selected view
and allows showing a listing for a 'selection' of users. That's explained here behind and also in 'Views - Day' section
of this help.
 
* List: a grid with all the events for the current user, the common Grid.
* Day: a schedule from 8:00 to 20:00 where all the events of a specific day are shown.
  It has two sub-types that are chosen through the Self and Selection tabs that appear at the right of the same bar when 
  Day mode is active:
    o Self: there are shown the events of the chosen day for the current user.
    o Selection: when this tab is pressed, a pop-up window appears letting the user select a small group of people so 
       that the list of events will have as many columns as users selected; it will be seen a group schedule for the
       active day showing events of the selected users. 
* Week: a weekly schedule, like the common day schedule but for the seven days of the week simultaneously.
* Month: a monthly schedule, shows in a clear calendar table all the days of the month and the necessary days of
  previous and next months in order to complete all the weeks shown. 

When the Day, Week or Month view are active, it appears a schedule bar over the listings. It has the previous (<<), 
today and next (>>) links to change the day / week / month in sequence, or go to the calendar listing that corresponds
to 'today'. 
At the right of that bar, it will be shown the selected period in the following way, according to selected view:
Day view => selected day, e.g.: Thursday, 2009-10-08
Week view => selected week, e.g.: 41. Calendar week, 2009
Month view => selected month, e.g.: October, 2009

There is another way to move forward and backward the schedule: the scroll wheel of the mouse. Scrolling up or down the
mouse wheel over the listing will bring up the previous or next schedule respectively, depending on the selected view it
will jump a day, week or month.


[emph]Permissions[/emph]

There is no Access tab in this module, instead, it is used a Participants tab that allows adding participants to the
event. The owner (creator) of the event has Admin access, and the participants a limited Write access. See 'Participants 
tab' section of this help.


[emph]Scope of each event and participants[/emph]

When it is created an event with many participants, internally as many events as participants are created. This behavior
has a purpose: each participant has a unique event and he/she can modify its content, maybe add a note, and even delete
it.
When a participant modifies an event, those changes only affect his/her event, nobody else will see them.
When an owner modifies an event or tries to delete it, the action may be applied to his/her event or also to all 
participants, the system will eventually ask it. This is explained in detail in 'Participants tab' section of this help. 


[emph]Recurrence[/emph]

There is a tab Recurrence in the Form that allows setting a recurrence to the events so that the same event is repeated
later one or more times, according to a user defined pattern.
The resulting series of events may be later edited individually or all at once, and they will be connected as an 
individual series of recurrent events.
When an owner tries to Save changes made to an event that belongs to a series, or tries to delete it, the action may be 
applied to one event or all the series, the system will eventually ask it. This is explained in detail in 'Recurrence 
tab' section of this help. 


[emph]Add button[/emph]

The common Add button up the events listing has a special behavior here, it pre-fills some Form fields to help you. The
criterion is the following:

Start Date: if current client computer time is before 17:00, then it will be set at current date, if not, the next day.
Start Time:
  If current client computer time is before 8:00, then it will be set at 8:00.
  If current client computer time is between 8:00 and 17:00, then it will be set at the next hour and 0 minutes. For
  times that have 00 minutes, the same hour will be set.
  If current client computer time is 17:01 or after, it will be set at 8:00 (of the next day).
  E.g.: 05:45 => 08:00
        08:00 => 08:00
        08:05 => 09:00
        16:30 => 17:00
        17:05 => 08:00 (of the next day)
        20:00 => 08:00 (of the next day)
End Date: the same that Start Date.
End Time: one hour after Start Time.

The purpose of this criteria is to automatically pre-fill the dates and times with the next possible moment for the 
event.


[emph]Pop-up questions[/emph]

When an existing event is being modified and Save button is pressed, up to 2 pop-up questions may appear asking about
the way of saving the changes made. Those questions are related to participants and recurrence and are explained in
detail in the respective help of both tabs inside this documentation.
