[emph]Characteristics[/emph]

Month view is a month calendar for the selected month formed by 4, 5 or 6 complete weeks in order to cover all month
days. Each square represents a day, each of them may have events inside.

Each event will appear inside appropriate day showing its time length and title. 
  If it starts and ends on the same day, the start and end times will be shown.
  If it starts on a previous day and/or ends on a later day, an arrow will replace that start and/or end time so that
  you visually intuit that it doesn't start or end on that day. The next or previous square will show the continuation
  of the event.
The title of the event itself is a link to click on and open the event in the Form.


[emph]Color distinction in the days[/emph]

A color distinction is made to make the calendar clearer.

White: weekdays inside selected month except for current day.
Light blue: current day.
Light grey: weekend days of selected month.
Darker grey: days of previous and next month, if any, shown to complete the first and last shown rows.


[emph]Day link[/emph]

Each Day number in the Calendar is a link to the Day view for clicked day.


[emph]Add buttons[/emph] 

Each day box has a (+) plus button at the right side of the number. That's an Add button, if you press it, an empty Form 
will be opened with the following pre-filled fields to help you in adding the event.

1 - If the clicked day is not current day:
    Start Date: clicked date.
    Start Time: 8:00
    End Date: same that Start one.
    End Time: 9:00

2 - If the clicked day matches current day, same behavior that Add button over the listing:
    Start Date: if current client computer time is before 17:00, then it will be set at current date, if not, the next 
    day.
    Start Time:
      If current client computer time is before 8:00, then it will be set at 8:00.
      If current client computer time is between 8:00 and 17:00, then it will be set at the next hour and 0 minutes. For
      times that have 00 minutes, the same hour will be set.
      If current client computer time is 17:01 or after, it will be set at 8:00 (of the next day).
      E.g.: 05:45 => 08:00
            08:00 => 08:00
            08:05 => 09:00
            16:30 => 17:00
            17:05 => 08:00 (of the next day)
            20:00 => 08:00 (of the next day)
    End Date: the same that Start Date.
    End Time: one hour after Start Time.
