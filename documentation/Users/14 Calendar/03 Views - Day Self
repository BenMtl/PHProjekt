When you press Day tab, Day view is activated and Self is the default mode for it.

Day view provides two specific tabs at the right of the tab upper bar: Self and Selection.
Self represents the Day view for the logged user and Selection allows you to view the Day schedule of a specific 
selection of users, maybe one or more, that will be seen simultaneously in the same view so that you can compare the
activities and occupied / free time of them.

Here it will be explained the Self mode of Day view, for Selection mode go to 'Views - Day Self' section of this
help.


All the calendar based views (Day, Week and Month) have a schedule bar over the listing to change the current shown 
period, also it can be changed using the scroll wheel. This is explained in the Introduction section of Calendar help.


[emph]Characteristics[/emph]

This Day view is a schedule for the selected day formed by 24 rows that represent half an hour each one.
It will show each event as a rectangle occupying an amount of rows proportional to its length in time.
Inside the rectangle it will be shown the length of it; if it starts and ends on the selected day just the times will 
be there, if not, also the dates. Also it will be shown the title and the note if any. 
The title of the event itself is a link to click on and open the event in the Form.


[emph]Out of schedule events[/emph]

If an event occurs outside the time range covered by the schedule (8:00 to 20:00) it appears under it in text mode. If 
it starts and ends on the selected day, only start and end times are shown, if not, also the dates are shown. The title
of the event is a link to open it in the Form, like inside schedule events.


[emph]Multiple events[/emph]

The view provides support for simultaneous events, in that case each event will occupy just a part of the view width
sharing total panel width with the other event/s, so that the view keeps graphical clarity.   


[emph]Add buttons[/emph] 

Each row has a (+) plus button at the right of the hour. That's an Add button, if you press it, an empty Form will be
opened with the following pre-filled fields:

Start Date: selected date, the one that is shown in the schedule bar behind the tabs.
Start Time: the one of the clicked row.
End Date: the same that Start Date.
End Time: one hour after Start Time.
