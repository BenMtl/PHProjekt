Press Week tab to activate this view.

All the calendar based views (Day, Week and Month) have a schedule bar over the listing to change the current shown 
period, also it can be changed using the scroll wheel. This is explained in the Introduction section of Calendar help.


[emph]Characteristics[/emph]

Week view is a schedule for the selected week formed by 24 rows that represent half an hour each one, and 7 columns, one
for each week day.
Each column works like a Day schedule. It will show each event as a rectangle occupying an amount of rows proportional 
to its length in time. 
Inside the rectangle it will be shown the length of it. 
  If it starts and ends on the selected day, the start and end times will be shown.
  If it starts on a previous day and/or ends on a later day, an arrow will replace that start and/or end time so that
  you visually intuit that it doesn't start and/or end on that day.
The title of the event itself is a link to click on and open the event in the Form.


[emph]Multiple events[/emph]

The view provides support for simultaneous events, in that case each event will occupy just a part of the day column 
width sharing it with the other event/s, so that the view keeps graphical clarity.   


[emph]Header link[/emph]

Each column header is a link to the Day view for clicked day.


[emph]Add buttons[/emph] 

Each day header has a (+) plus button at the left side. That's an Add button, if you press it, an empty Form will be
opened with the following pre-filled fields to help you in adding the event.

1 - If the clicked day is not current day:
    Start Date: clicked date.
    Start Time: 8:00
    End Date: same that Start one.
    End Time: 9:00

2 - If the clicked day matches current day, same behavior that Add button over the listing:
    Start Date: if current client computer time is before 17:00, then it will be set at current date, if not, the next 
    day.
    Start Time:
      If current client computer time is before 8:00, then it will be set at 8:00.
      If current client computer time is between 8:00 and 17:00, then it will be set at the next hour and 0 minutes. For
      times that have 00 minutes, the same hour will be set.
      If current client computer time is 17:01 or after, it will be set at 8:00 (of the next day).
      E.g.: 05:45 => 08:00
            08:00 => 08:00
            08:05 => 09:00
            16:30 => 17:00
            17:05 => 08:00 (of the next day)
            20:00 => 08:00 (of the next day)
    End Date: the same that Start Date.
    End Time: one hour after Start Time.
