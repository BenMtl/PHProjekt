Apart from the common Grid fields like checkbox, pencil and Id, there are the following fields in the Todo Grid:

[emph]Title[/emph]

Text: the title of the item, e.g.: 'Buy 5 notebooks for the team'.


[emph]Start Date[/emph]

Date: when task is planned to start, or indeed started.


[emph]End Date[/emph]

Date: when task is planned to end, or indeed ended.


[emph]Priority[/emph]

Select: a number between 1 and 10 for the priority. When you have many items in the Grid, you can sort them into the
priority clicking the header of that column. It may be ranked in ascending or descending order.


[emph]User[/emph]

A user the task has been assigned to. He/she is the one to do it.


[emph]Status[/emph]

The options are self-descriptive:
