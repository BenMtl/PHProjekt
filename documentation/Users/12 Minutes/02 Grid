Apart from the common Grid fields like checkbox, pencil and Id, there are the following fields in the Minute Grid:

Date: date when the meeting takes place.


[emph]Start Time[/emph]

Time: time when the meeting takes place.

Text: the title of the Minute, e.g.: 'Moving to a new office'.


[emph]Description[/emph]

Textarea: a brief description of the meeting (the content and subjects themselves will be written in Items tab of the 
Form).


[emph]Place[/emph]

Text: where the meeting takes place.


[emph]Status[/emph]

Select: the status of the item, this is supposed to change over time when the meeting takes place and contents are
filled.
The options are self-descriptive:
1 - Planned: the first state.
2 - Empty 
3 - Filled: this status is set automatically when some content is filled inside Items tab.
4 - Final: this status makes the item to be read-only, because it is supposed to be finalized.

After the status is saved as Final, no content can be modified unless you change it back to Filled state.
