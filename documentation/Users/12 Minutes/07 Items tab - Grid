The purpose is that, when meeting contents are 100% filled in this Tab Grid, it shows all the contents of the meeting
ordered, maybe chronologically, and showing behind each Topic row its statements, todos, decisions and dates so that the
Grid is a clear representation of all main events and ideas discussed during the meeting.

It has many columns but not all of them are used in the five kind of items added from the Form.

Columns:

[emph]Topic[/emph]

Each time a item of Topic type row is added to the Grid this column shows an integer that follows the previous one.
E.g.: if you add a Topic as the first item for Items Grid, it will show number 1 in this column. If you add another one
behind it, it will show number 2.
The rest of types of items added here will be under a Topic and will have the Topic's number plus a point and a 
'inside-Topic' element number. So that if you add a 'Statement' row behind Topic 1, it will show here '1.1'. If there is
no any Topic over it, it will show '0.1'.
This column shows a value on all types of rows.


[emph]Title[/emph]

This column is used in the five types of rows and represents the title of the row. 


[emph]Type[/emph]

May be: Topic, Statement, Todo, Decision or Date.


[emph]Date[/emph]

This column is just used in the rows of the type 'Todo' and 'Date', the Date for doing a Todo or the Date of an event. 


[emph]Who[/emph]

This column is just used by Todo type rows. It represents who is going to do the task.
