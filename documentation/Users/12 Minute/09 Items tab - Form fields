1 - Topic:
This is a subject discussed or exposed in the meeting, it will content other items inside.
Each time a item of Topic type is added to the Grid that column shows an integer that follows the previous one.
E.g.: if you add a Topic as the first item for Items Grid, it will show number 1 in this column. If you add another one
behind it, it will show number 2.
The rest of types of items added there will be under a Topic and will have the Topic's number plus a point and a 
'inside-Topic' element number. So that if you add a 'Statement' row behind Topic 1, it will show here '1.1'. If there is
no any Topic over it, it will show '0.1'.
That column is used by all types of rows.
