There are two Grids in Minute module, the common one up the Form, and another smaller one, inside Items tab. This last
one is explained in 'Items tab' sections of this help.

Concerning the main Grid, apart from the common Grid fields like checkbox, pencil and Id, there are the following fields 
inside it:

[emph]Date of Meeting[/emph]

Date: date when the meeting takes place.


[emph]Start Time[/emph]

Time: time when the meeting takes place.


[emph]Title[/emph]

Text: the title of the Minute, e.g.: 'Moving to a new office'.


[emph]Description[/emph]

Textarea: a brief description of the meeting (the content and subjects themselves will be written in Items tab of the 
Form).


[emph]Place[/emph]

Text: where the meeting takes place.


[emph]Status[/emph]

Select: the status of the item, this is supposed to change over time when the meeting takes place and contents are
filled.
The options are self-descriptive:
1 - Planned: the first state.
2 - Empty 
3 - Filled: this status is set automatically when some content is filled inside Items tab.
4 - Final: this status makes the item to be read-only, because it is supposed to be finalized.

After the status is saved as Final, no content can be modified unless you change it back to Filled state.
