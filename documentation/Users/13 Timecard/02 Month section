Month section is a list of the days for the selected month which shows at the right side of each day the booked time for
the logged user on that day. On top of all the booked amounts for each day, there is the total amount of the month.

Each listed day is a link to load it onto the center Day section; if you click on any day of the list, the Day schedule 
will load all booked Projects for that day, if any, and the Date field on top of the schedule will be filled with that
date. Also, it will be loaded the clicked date into the Date field inside the right Form.

To change the listed month, select a date of any month in the Date field over the Day schedule and click its check
button.
