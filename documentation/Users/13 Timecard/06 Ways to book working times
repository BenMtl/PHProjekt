The way to add new bookings to Timecard is always the same: firstly setting the Form in Add mode, that's when the button 
Delete is not there and only Save is visible. When you enter Timecard module or after saving a booking it is 
automatically set in Add mode, but there are also some ways to pre-fill some fields while getting it into Add mode:


[emph]Clicking on a day in Month view or selecting a date in Date field[/emph]

If you click on any day of the Month section, the Day schedule will load all booked Projects for that day, if any, and 
the Date field on top of the schedule will be filled with that date. Also, it will be loaded the clicked date into the 
Date field inside the right Form getting the Form in Add mode and the rest of fields will be emptied.
The same happens in the Form if a day is selected in the Date field over the center schedule.


[emph]Clicking a (+) plus sign in a schedule row[/emph]

Each row of the schedule has a (+) plus sign to add a booking for that time. If you press it the selected Date and Time 
will be loaded into the Form in fields Date and Start Time, and the Form will get into Add mode and the rest of fields 
is emptied. The End Time will be filled automatically as one hour after Start Time.


[emph]Clicking on a favorite Project[/emph]

When you click on any of the favorite Projects under the Form, this last one is emptied, set into Add mode, Project 
field is filled with clicked Project and the Start Time is set to current time.
