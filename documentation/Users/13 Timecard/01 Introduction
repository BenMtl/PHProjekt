Timecard is a module designed to assign working times to Projects so that it is kept a record about what the people
involved in the Projects have worked in, and how much time have they spent on each thing.
These times will also impact on Statistic module.

[emph]Sections of the module[/emph]

It has a month section at the left which shows all days of selected month and booked time for each one for the logged 
user. On top of all the booked amounts for each day, there is the sum of all them.
Each day is a link for you to click on and load its contents in the Day section, in the middle of the screen. 

The Day section has a Date type field on top that permits to change not only the day but also the month and year both
showed in Month left view and this Day view. Behind it there is a schedule for the day. The purpose of it is that the
user may perceive graphically the amount of time worked for selected day and the Projects involved.

At the right top of the module view there is a Form to add, edit and delete Project bookings.

Finally, at the right bottom of the Timecard view there is the Favorite Projects sections that provides a way to access
rapidly to a Project to add it to a specific time booking.

There is an export button on the top left of the module that exports in CSV file format all booked times for logged user
and selected month.


[emph]Overlapping times error[/emph]

When you try to add or edit a booking so that some of its time overlaps part of the time of another booking, an internal 
checking will bring up an error for you to correct the start and end time of it and/or the date.
