The right Form provides a couple of fields to add or edit bookings.

You can add an item pressing the (+) plus sign in the center schedule and the Form will be loaded with the Date and Time
pressed, and End time set to 1 hour after Start Time. You select a Project, write a Note and press Save to add it.
To edit a booking, click on it inside the day schedule; its contents will be loaded into the Form. Make changes and
press Save, or just press Delete to take out the booking from the schedule.
