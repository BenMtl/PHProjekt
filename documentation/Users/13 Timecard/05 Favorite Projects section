Favorite Projects section is located at the right bottom of the module and provides shortcuts to most booked Projects,
or the ones you want to put there. This list of Projects is independent for each user. 

When you click on any of the favorite Projects the Form is emptied and Project field is filled with clicked Project and 
the Start Time is set to current time, then you are ready to fill the rest of fields and press Save to add the booking.

This listing of favorite Projects is located between the Form and the button 'Manage project list'. Projects available 
to be added to favorites list are those you have at least Read access to.

If there are not any Projects in the listing under the Form, or you want to add one or modify the listing, press 
'Manage project list' button.
When you press 'Manage project list' button, a little pop-up window appears. It has two panels. The left one shows all 
Projects and Sub-Projects you are involved in, it allows you to drag and drop each Project with the mouse to the second
panel, at the right. That right panel is the one that has the Projects that will be seen under the Form when you save 
changes pressing the Check button and this window gets closed.

If you want to take out a Project from the right panel of this pop-up window, drag and drop it back to the left panel 
using the mouse.

When you have finished doing the changes, press the Check button to save and close the pop-up window. The new Projects
listing appears under the Form. Each Project is shown as a yellow ochre color rectangle with curved ends.
