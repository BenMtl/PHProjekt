Apart from the common Grid fields like checkbox, pencil and Id, there are the following fields in the Todo Grid:

[emph]Title[/emph]

Text: the title of the item, e.g.: 'Fix my notebook'.


[emph]Date[/emph]

Display: a read-only mode field that is automatically filled with the date of creation of the item.


[emph]Author[/emph]

Display: a read-only mode field that is automatically filled with the name of the user who created the item.


[emph]Assigned[/emph]

A user the ticket is assigned to, if any. He/she is the one to solve it.
When this user is selected, or it is changed to another user, some rights are assigned to him/her: Read, Write, Delete
and Download access.


[emph]Priority[/emph]

Select: a number between 1 and 10 for the priority. When you have many items in the Grid, you can sort them into the
priority clicking the header of that column. It may be ranked in ascending or descending order.


[emph]Status[/emph]

Select: the status of the item, this is supposed to change over time as the task advances.
The options are self-descriptive:
1 - Open: the first state.
2 - Assigned: you select it when item has been assigned to a user.
3 - Solved: this is supposed to be the final state for a solved issue.
4 - Verified: the issue was corroborated but it wasn't solved nor closed.
5 - Closed: this is supposed to be the final state for a NON-solved issue.

When the status is set to Solved, the fields Solved By and Solved Date in the form are automatically filled with the
logged user name and current date respectively. If you change Solved status by another one, those 2 fields are emptied
again.
