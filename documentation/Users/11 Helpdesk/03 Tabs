Form tabs:

[emph]Basic Data[/emph]

Fields here are the specific ones of Helpdesk module, where you can enter the data of the item. It has title, creation
data, parent Project, priority, status, assigned user, etc. See 'Basic Data tab' section of this help.


[emph]Access[/emph]

A tab present in many modules, explained in the following section of User help: Default -> Form -> Access Tab

There is an exception here: there are some permissions added automatically to the assigned user, if any: Read, Write,
Download and Delete ones, so that he/she can work on the item. 
The permissions will be added after the item is saved and will be seen next time it is open, in Access tab.
If the assigned user is changed to another one, these rights are added to the new user.


[emph]Notification[/emph]

A tab present in many modules, explained in the following section of User help: Default -> Form -> Notification Tab 

The particular criterion of this module for determining to whom send the notification is the following:
* If there is no assigned user, or there is one and it is the logged user, send it to the creator
* If there is an assigned user and he/she is not the logged one, send it just to the assigned user.
* If the assigned user has just been changed, send it also to the old one.
