There are many types of help provided in the system.

[emph]Help top link[/emph]

This is the biggest help showed inside the system.

Clicking on it will open a pop-up dialog showing general help plus particular help of the active module. It has a
navigable set of tabs at the top with many sections.
If you want to see other module's help, close the dialog, enter that module and press Help link again.


[emph]Help icons[/emph]

All over the site may be found little round help icons with an interrogation mark inside that are tooltip help for
specific things like fields and panels, just where those icons are located. You can click them or just take the mouse 
over them to make it appear the related help text as a little floating text.


[emph]Error messages[/emph]

When there are performed wrong actions the system will warn the user of it in a message at the top right of the screen,
that message will be in the user defined language and will vanish automatically within a couple of seconds.
E.g.: wrong filled fields or when user tries to do things that he/she are not allowed to.
