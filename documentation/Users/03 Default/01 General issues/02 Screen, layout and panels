When a Project is selected clicking on the logo, on a item of the Tree or after clicking on a result of a search, etc.,
all Project-modules related to that Project are shown in the white top module bar.

They are not always visible and they are not always the same ones, in order to see that module tabs, a Project has to be
selected as previously explained: maybe clicking on the top left logo to select the Root Project, or clicking on a 
Project of the tree to select a specific Project, or even after searching for an item or entering an absolute item URL 
in the address bar.
For example, clicking on the logo will activate Root Project and show in the top white bar all the Project-modules:
Project, Gantt, Statistic, Todo, Note, Filemanager, Minute and Helpdesk.

The amount of Project modules shown depends on the selected Project because it defines its own associated modules in a
tab called 'Module'. Also it depends on the rights of logged user for the selected Project.

Clicking on a Module will load its contents in the Grid and Form sections, this subject is explained later in this text 
and also explained in detail in other sections of User Help.

projects (those which depend on the Root one), and expand one and see just its children, and then maybe click on one
Project and see/change its contents in the center of the screen.
