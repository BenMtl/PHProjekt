There are some values stored in browser's cookies to simplify the user experience in the site.
All these navigation attributes that will be mentioned here, are stored automatically, except for 'Keep me logged'
functionality. 


[emph]Keep me logged[/emph]

When you log in you can check the box 'Keep me logged', and it will save a pair of cookies:

* An encrypted string 
* Your user Id

Both values will match Phprojekt database data to let you access the site without writing your user and password after
your session time has expired, or you restart the computer, etc. The expiration time will be initially of 1 week.
Each time you get logged automatically using the cookies, the expiration time of them is set to 1 week from that moment
again, both in your browser cookies and in Phprojekt database. If you don't log for 1 week or more, they won't work any
more and you have to enter your data again to log in.

To inactive these pair of cookies, just log out of the site using the top right link.


[emph]Location[/emph]

The location where you are navigating is stored in the cookies so that if you log out or close the browser, next time
you log into the site or enter the root path to access it, you will be taken there.
The location URL involves the active module, selected item if any, and parent Project if any.


[emph]Grid column list order and direction[/emph]

The order of the items in the listing can be modified and make it depend on one particular column, clicking on
the column. When a column is clicked, a triangle facing up will be shown at the top right of the column header, and will
the listing will be ordered according to the content of that column for each row (A to Z). If you click it again, the
order criterion will remain the same but its direction will get opposite (Z to A).
This order criteria, if any, is stored individually for each module in the cookies.


[emph]Grid vertical scroll position[/emph]

When the grid listing exceeds panel's height a vertical scrollbar appears letting you scroll the content up and down.
That listing position is stored individually for each module in the cookies.


[emph]Grid and Form panel's height[/emph]

The height of Grid and Form can be changed taking the mouse pointer over the bottom horizontal border between them and
clicking and dragging it up or down to increase or decrease panel's height.
That border position is stored in the cookies, it may be saved as a shared value for many modules that have Grid and 
Form sections.
