Field types, mostly shown in Basic Data tab:

[emph]Text[/emph] 

Plain alphanumeric fields of one line.
E.g.: Project 'title', 'budget', 'tag'

Note - Tag field
'Tag' field, which is at the bottom of Basic Data's fields on all modules except for Administration and Setting ones, has
a special behavior, it is used for showing a link to the item in the Tags panel at the bottom left of the screen.
More info in 'Tags panel' section of this User help.


[emph]Select box[/emph]

Allows you to choose one among many pre-defined options.

E.g.: may be a Project, a User, a Contact, Yes/No, Status, Priority number.


[emph]Textarea[/emph]

Multiple line field with two possible formats: Text and HTML.
At the right of the field there is an icon to switch between both formats. Text mode is used normally, if HTML mode is
selected a pop-up dialog editor is opened with all kind of options at the top, for text style and HTML format including
links and images, then you have a Save button at the bottom to apply changes which also gets the dialog closed.

E.g: Note, description.


[emph]Date[/emph]

When you click on the Date field a dynamic Calendar appears behind it for you to choose in a clear and friendly way a 
specific day. You can also write the date as a plain string in the field '2009-09-24'

E.g.: Start Date, End Date


[emph]Time[/emph]

When you click on a Time field a dynamic panel with many possible time options appears up or down the field for you to
scroll with the mouse over them and click on one. You can also write the time as a plain string in the field '10:00'.

E.g.: Calendar 'Start time'

[emph]Percentage[/emph]

This is a slide bar where you can pick the knob with the mouse and drag it left and right to the new selection for the
percentage.

E.g.: Project 'Percentage completed'

 
[emph]Upload[/emph]

This field allows you to upload one or more files.
Its way of work is absolutely intuitive: press the button at the right of the field, choose a file from your computer
and the file is sent.
Then the uploaded file appears behind the field with a cross button at its right side to delete it. The file itself is a
link to download it.

E.g.: Filemanager module 'Upload' field


[emph]Multiple Select box[/emph]

It is like the Select box but is an open list with many visible options at a time for you to choose more than one,
clicking on them while holding CTRL key.

E.g.: Minutes module, all fields inside People tab


[emph]Display[/emph]

Just used to show fields that never can be changed clicking on them. They depend on another field or particular 
behavior of the module.

E.g.: Helpdesk 'Author' and 'Date'
