[emph]Location[/emph]

The grid, when it is shown, is situated at the upper center of the screen, behind the Project-Modules white tab bar and
the buttons and breadcrumb trail.


[empth]What's the grid?[/emph]

The grid is an editable list of items for the selected module plus some extra items for performing actions on them. The 
items listed are those that you have Read access to. If there are no available items for the selected module and logged
user, no grid is shown, just a legend 'There are no entries on this level'.


[emph]Resize panel[/emph]

You can resize the grid panel in two ways:

Vertically
Take the mouse pointer over the bottom horizontal border of the grid panel, generally the pointer will get 
into a different icon like a vertical bar with one arrow on each point. Click and drag the mouse up or down to
increase or decrease panel's height.

Horizontally
Take the mouse pointer over the left vertical border between the tree and the grid, click and drag the mouse
left or right to widen or narrow the grid's width respectively. 


[emph]Exceptions[/emph]

When using Project module and selected a Project from the tree, the Basic Data of it is shown in the center of the 
screen without any Grid. Then, if the Project has associated modules you can choose another tab and the Grid will be 
shown with the list of items for that clicked module tab. 

There are some modules like Gantt, Statistic, Timecard and Setting that don't use a Grid.

In Calendar module the use of a Grid is optional because the module provides also some calendar based views that replace
the grid: Day, Week and Month views.

Minute module has, in addition to the common Grid, another grid inside Items tab of the Form. That point will be
explained in detail in Minutes section of this User help.
