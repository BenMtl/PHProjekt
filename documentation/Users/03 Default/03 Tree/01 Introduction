Projects tree

All projects depend on another, except for the Root project called 'PHProjekt', this is the parent Project, directly or
indirectly of the rest of the Projects.
You can see Project help for more details.

The purpose of the tree is to show a hierarchical structure of Projects and Sub-Projects, where you can see all main
Projects (those which depend on the Root one), and expand one and see just its children, and then maybe click on one
Project and see/change its contents in the center of the screen.


[emph]How to use the tree[/emph]

All the main Projects (those that depend on the Root one) are showed inside a horizontal orange square.
You can click on them and all the Project info will be loaded into the upper center part of screen: 
* All the related modules will be shown in the top white bar as independent tabs in the following way
  <"Basic Data">  <module1> <module2> <module3> <etc>

<Module1>, 2, 3 are the associated modules according to the Project settings, like Todo, Notes, etc.

When you are navigating inside a global module; those top right linked ones which don't depend on a specific Project, 
the Tree gets faded out to make you know you aren't inside any Project.

When you are working inside a specific Project, that Project inside the tree gets dark bolder.


[emph]Toggle the projects to see Sub-Projects[/emph]

If the Project shown inside the orange square has sub-projects, then a [+] plus sign will be shown at the left of its
name allowing you to click on it for the tree to get expanded vertically to show its Sub-Projects behind it.
Now, you can click on whatever Sub-Project, to select it and make it the active project as explained in 'How to use the
tree', or, if this Sub-Project also has Sub-Projects, click on the [+] sign to see them.


[emph]Access system to see the projects[/emph]

You will see in the tree those Projects whose permission for you is at least Read access.
By default, all users have all rights (of course including Read access) to the Projects they create. Then, inside Access
tab they may give rights to other users, so that other users can see them in the tree and eventually perform some
actions.


[emph]Resize panel[/emph]

You can resize the panel in two ways:

Horizontally: put the mouse pointer over the right vertical border of the tree panel, generally the pointer will get 
into a different icon like a horizontal bar with one arrow on each point. Click and drag the mouse left or right to
widen or narrow panel's width.

Vertically: the Tags panel behind the tree has a cross button to close it, then you can open it again through the same
button that is converted into a triangle figure.
Closing that panel will provide more available height for the tree.
