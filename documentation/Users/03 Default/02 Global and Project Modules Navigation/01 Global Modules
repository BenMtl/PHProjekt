The right top section that has the links "Calendar", "Contact", "Timecard", and so on, provides links to modules that 
are not directly associated to a Project: those are the Global Modules; their items do not necessarily depend on a 
Project, they will be there no matter what Project is selected in the tree, because their items, unlike Project-modules
(Todo, Filemanager, Notes, etc.) are not children of Projects.

Just click on one of them and its content will be filled in the Grid and Form panels, the module may join both panels
into one, depending on its content. Then, you are ready to work on the module. The tree will get faded out to make it
clear that you are working outside any specific Project.


[emph]Calendar[/emph]

Manages many kinds of events that are situated in a specific date and time in a calendar.

Permissions:
It doesn't work with user defined Access item permission nor Project role permission. Its permissions are assigned
automatically in the following way for each series of events:
  Owner (creator) of the event: all rights
  Extra participants (if any): Read, Write and Delete access, for his/her events, if one of his/her event is deleted, 
  the events of the owner and the rest of participants for that day will continue existing.   


[emph]Contact[/emph]

A contact book to store data of people, that can be also associated with Projects and Helpdesk tickets, from the form of
those modules. The contacts are independent from the users registered in the system.

Permissions:
There is a field 'Private' used for determining whether each contact is private or not so that everyone can see it; or
just the creator is able to do it.


[emph]Timecard[/emph]

To charge working hours and assign them to the Projects. It has a visual interface and is very easy to use.

Permissions:
Every user has just access to his/her schedule and bookings, and can assign worked time just to Projects he/she has at
least Read access to.


[emph]Setting[/emph]

Here the user sets and changes specific configuration parameters of his/her profile, like password, e-mail, etc.
It is divided into User and Timecard, for general settings and favorite projects respectively.
 
Permissions:
The user just can change his/her own settings.


[emph]Administration[/emph]

Only available for Admin type users, the general site administration section.
It is divided into: Module, Tab, User and Role.

Permissions:
Only admin users can enter here and modify things that concern all system and all users.



Note: All these modules are explained in detail inside their respective sections of the User help.
