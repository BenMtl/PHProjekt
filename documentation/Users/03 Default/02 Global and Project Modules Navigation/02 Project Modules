[emph]Introduction[/emph]

The middle top white module bar has a series of tabs like "Project", "Gantt", "Statistic", etc. according to the
selected Project: maybe the Root one or a Tree one. Those modules are directly associated to a Project, if the
selected Project has associated modules (Project -> Module tab in the form), then, they will be seen there at the right 
of Basic Data tab when that Project is selected in the Tree.
All the items of these Project-modules are children of its parent Projects.


They are not always visible and not always the same ones; in order to see them, a Project has to be selected: maybe 
clicking on the top left logo to select the Root Project or clicking on a Project of the tree to select a specific
Project, or even after searching for an item or entering an absolute item URL in the address bar, etc.

For example, clicking on the logo will activate Root Project and show in the top white bar all the Project-modules:
Project, Gantt, Statistic, Todo, Note, Filemanager, Minute and Helpdesk.

As it was previously said, the amount of Project modules shown depends on the selected Project because it defines its 
own associated modules. Also, they depend on the rights of logged user for the selected Project.

Just click on one of that modules and its content will be filled in the Grid and Form panels, the module may join both 
panels into one, depending on its content. Then, you are ready to work on the module. 


[emph]Project[/emph]

The Projects are the most important part of the system. The user creates a Project to work with, and then loads all the
data on the Project itself plus the associated modules that were activated for it (view Module tab inside a project). As
time goes by, data can be added or modified.

Permissions:
Each module has 2 permission tabs that define the rights that users will have for that Project and its children and
associated modules: Role and Access. For more info on permissions see 'Permissions' part of this Help.
