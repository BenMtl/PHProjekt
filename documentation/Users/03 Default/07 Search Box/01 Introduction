[emph]Introduction[/emph]

At the top right of screen there is a Search box where you can type whatever you want and it will be searched over the
modules and its content. It maybe a title, part of it, or the content of some specific fields detailed here later.


[emph]How to use the Search[/emph]

While you type anything into the box, it will be searched and shown behind it, as soon as you reach the third typed 
character. The search process shows a floating dialog behind the search box with the results, if any.
If a result is found, it is shown inside that dialog the module for the item, the title and some description.
If no results are found, "There are no Results" legend appears.


[emph]Which field values you can search for[/emph]
 
The fields used for searching in, are the title of all items you have at least Read access to, the description or note
for it and the Tag field.
 

[emph]Click on a result[/emph]
 
You can click on a result of the floating dialog results and it will be open for you to see it and/or modify it
according to your permissions.
 

[emph][emph]Results big list - Click on 'View All'[/emph]

Clicking on View All at the bottom of the floating results dialog, will make the results be shown bigger, in the center 
of the screen in the place where Grid and Form are shown.
 
If too many results are shown at the same time, you can click on the circle icon with the triangle inside, at the left
of the top bar of each result to contract or expand the item, so that more results can fit in the screen.
To access to an item and open it just click on the item name.


[emph]Permissions[/emph]

You will see just those results corresponding to items that you have at least Read access to.
