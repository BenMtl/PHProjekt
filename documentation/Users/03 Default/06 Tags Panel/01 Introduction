[emph]Tags panel[/emph]

It is located at the bottom left of the screen. It is a Tag Cloud with tags that has been defined, for the items of the 
site.
Its purpose is to provide a quick access method to frequently accessed items, and important ones, clicking on each link.


[emph]Tag field in the form[/emph]

'Tag' field is at the bottom of Basic Data's fields on all modules except for Administration and Setting ones, when
you fill that field for an item and Save it, that tag will appear in the Tags panel for you to access the item from 
there.


[emph]Format[/emph]

Each tag should not have spaces, e.g.:
Wrong -> 'Project 1'
Right -> 'Project1'

More than one tag can be set for an item, e.g.:
'computers export'
This would add 2 tags to the Tags panel


[emph]Tags list[/emph]

As more than one item could have the same tag, when you click on a tag inside the panel, a results list is open in the
center of the screen, occupying the Grid and Form space.
It shows one or more items according to the clicked tag, showing for each result the module and the item's main data.
If too many results are shown at the same time, you can click on the circle icon with the triangle inside, at the left
of the top bar of each result to contract or expand the item, so that more results can fit in the screen.
To access to an item and open it just click on the item name.   


[emph]Permissions[/emph]

You will see just those tags corresponding to items that you have at least Read access to.


[emph]Resize panel[/emph]
 
Tags panel has a cross button to close it at the left of its title. Then you can open it again through the same
button that is converted into a triangle figure.
