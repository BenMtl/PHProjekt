There are two ways of modifying times of a Project through the mouse and the bars: Moving and Resizing them.

[emph]Moving the Bars[/emph]

Click on the body of any of them (not the darker left and right borders) and without releasing the mouse button, drag
them left or right to the new position.
You won't be able to drag it to a point outside the timeline, like a previous or posterior year.


[emph]Resizing the Bars[/emph]

You can click on a bar border and without releasing the mouse drag it left or back to increase or decrease Project
length.


[emph]Selected Project Timeline panel[/emph]

When you click on the bar, like in the previous cases, a panel 'Selected Project Timeline' appears showing you the exact
Start and End dates for the Project.
Also, after you drag or resize a bar using the mouse, those dates will be shown and get updated automatically 
according to the new position of the bar.
See 'Changing dates using the panels' part of this help for more details of the panel use.
