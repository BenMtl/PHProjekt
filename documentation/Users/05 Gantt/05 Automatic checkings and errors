After you change Project dates either from the bar (moving the whole bar or just a border of it) or upper panel fields,
internal checks are performed. If any error is found, one of the following four errors will be brought up in a dialog
for you to choose what to do. XX in the error title means a Project name.

Note: all errors are connected with the fact that in this structure of Projects hierarchy all Sub-Projects are supposed
to happen inside parent's time. 


Errors:


[emph]Subproject XX starts before parent project XX[/emph]

When you change a Start date of a Project so that any of its children now starts before it, this error appears.

The Error pop-up dialog offers you to choose one of these three options:
  Click OK for the Sub-Project Start date to be moved forward to match parent's Start date.
  Click Reset to restore the moved Project to its previous position and/or width.
  Click the top right [x] cross button or Esc to leave things as they are.


[emph]Subproject XX ends after parent project XX[/emph]

When you change an End date of a Project so that now it ends before any of its children, this error appears.

The Error pop-up dialog offers you to choose one of these three options:
  Click OK for the Sub-Project End date to be moved backwards to match parent's End date.
  Click Reset to restore the moved Project to its previous position and/or width.
  Click the top right [x] cross button or Esc to leave things as they are.
