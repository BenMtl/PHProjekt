[emph]Listed Projects[/emph]

The listed Projects are those you have at least Read access to, and also that they have filled 'Start Date' and 'End 
Date' values.
 
Firstly there will be listed all Projects that are children of the active one, no matter whether it is Root Project
(PHProjekt) or another one.
If one of the listed Projects has at least one child, it will be shown a [+] plus sign at its left for you to click it
or the Project name and open it and see its children under it. The children may also have Sub-Projects, and so on.


[emph]Timeline[/emph]

According to the earlier Start Date and latest End Date for all the Projects, a specific amount of years will fill the
horizontal scope of the timeline.
The timeline always starts in January and ends in December but those months not necessary correspond to the same year.
For all years that have at least one month occupied by a Project bar, 12 months will be shown.
E.g.: If 2 Projects are listed, one starting in Jul-08 and ending in Aug-08, and the other starting in Dec-08 and ending
in Mar-09 then 24 months will be shown in the timeline, from Jan-08 to Dic-09. 


[emph]Bars[/emph]

The bar of each Project occupies a proportional horizontal surface and position according its dates, so that you can 
visually perceive its duration in time, relation and proportion paying attention to the column headers, and compare it
with its Sub-Projects, parent or another Projects.
