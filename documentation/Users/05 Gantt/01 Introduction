This module is a Gantt chart interface, mouse editable, which is automatically synchronized with the data stored in the 
database.

A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish 
dates of the terminal (children) elements and summary (parent) elements of a Project.
The module reads the Projects and Subprojects and elaborates a graphic that has one horizontal bar per Project 
(timeline) which can be moved with the mouse scrolling it over time or just increasing or decreasing the start and end 
dates.

Up the chart there is a space where a panel called 'Selected Project Timeline' appears. When you click on a Project 
timeline bar, this panel's fields get loaded with the start and end dates of clicked bar Project, so that you can see 
and/or modify them writing different dates or selecting them in the calendar that pops up for each field.
