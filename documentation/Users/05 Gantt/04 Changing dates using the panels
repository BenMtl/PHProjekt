You can see the exact Start and End dates for any bar of the Projects.

Just click on one bar, and a panel called 'Selected Project Timeline' will appear on top of the window Gantt section
showing you both dates. After changing any bar width and/or position, both fields get updated automatically with the
changes made to the bar.


[emph]Modifying the Dates using those fields[/emph]

Those 2 dates are editable; you can click on any of them and pick a date in the dynamic pop-up calendar that appears
behind, or write it manually in the field.
Then press the Check button; if no error is found the bar will move onto its new parameters.
