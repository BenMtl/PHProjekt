This global module is a contact book to store data of people, that can be also associated with Projects and Helpdesk 
tickets, from the form of those modules. The contacts are independent from the users registered in the system.


Permissions:

There is a field 'Private' used for determining whether each contact is private or not so that everyone can see it; or
just the creator is able to do it.
