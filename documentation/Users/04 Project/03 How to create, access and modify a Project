An existing Project that you have at least Read access to, can be accessed from:


[emph]Logo[/emph]

Actually, all users can access the Root Project.
If you click the site's top left logo, Project will get the active module and the Grid will show all main Projects, it
means, all Projects that have the 'Root' Project as its parent.


[emph]Tree[/emph]

The tree is a friendly hierarchical navigable structure of existing Projects that lets users observe the dependencies 
among them and open a specific one inside Grid and Form.
If you want to work on the Project-modules associated to a specific Project or Sub-Project, accessing it from here will
show all them in the Tab bar over the Form.


[emph]Grid[/emph]

You can make the Grid show Projects clicking the top right logo of the site; the Grid will list all Projects that depend
on the Root one, then if you click the pencil of any of those rows, the Form will show all available info for the 
Project, except for the associated modules' content.
Another way to make the Grid show Projects is when the clicked Project in the Tree has 'Project' module associated in
the Form -> 'Module' tab. You will see 'Project' tab at the right of 'Basic Data' tab. Yes, the Project item can have
its own module associated and can show its Sub-Projects there. 


[emph]Notification Link[/emph]

When sent an email Notification about the creation or modification of a Project, its content provides a direct URL link
for it, you can open a Project entering that URL.


[emph]Search[/emph]

You can perform a search using the top right text box to find and open a Project.


[emph]Tag[/emph]

Clicking on a Tag that corresponds to a Project lets you enter and see its contents.


Once you have reached the Project of your choice, you can perform all activities that you were given access to.
