[emph]Scenario[/emph]

The following Role is defined:
    "Senior Developer":
        Todo module:        (read, write, create)
        Filemanager module: (read, create)
        Rest of modules:    ()

User "John" has been assigned 
    "Senior developer" Role on "Project 1"

"Project 1" has the following "Todo" module items:
    
    #1. "Write documentation"
    There is no user specified in "Access" tab.

    #2. "Call Mr.Hanson"
    User "John" has Read access in "Access" tab.

And also, "Project 1" has the following "Notes" module item:

    #1. "How to cook a Banana Tarte Tatin"
    User "John" has Read and Write access in "Access" tab.


And also, "Project 1" has the following "Helpdesk" module item:

    #1. "Change front left wheel of the car"
    User "John" has Read and Write access in "Access" tab.



[emph]Result[/emph]

Todo item #1 "Write documentation", "John" can do nothing (even seeing it) because:
    Item access (Access tab):   None
    Role for parent Project:    Read, Write, Create
    Combination = {}

Todo item #2 "Call Mr.Hanson", "John" can 'Read' it because:
    Item access (Access tab):   Read
    Role for parent Project:    Read, Write, Create
    Combination = {Read}

Notes item #1 "How to cook a Banana Tarte Tatin", "John" can 'Read' and 'Write' it because:
    Item access (Access tab):   Read, Write
    Role for parent Project:    Read, Create
    Combination = {Read, Write} 
    Note: In this specific case, a combination between Write and Create gives Write access. The same result
    happens with Write and Write, and Write and Admin accesses.

Helpdesk item #1 "Change front left wheel of the car", "John" can't even see the module tab because:
    Item access (Access tab):   Read, Write
    Role for parent Project:    -nothing-
    Combination = {}
